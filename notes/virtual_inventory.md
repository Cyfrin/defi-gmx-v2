```
// if the open interest for longs is increased then tokens were virtually bought from the pool
// so the virtual inventory should be decreased
// if the open interest for longs is decreased then tokens were virtually sold to the pool
// so the virtual inventory should be increased
// if the open interest for shorts is increased then tokens were virtually sold to the pool
// so the virtual inventory should be increased
// if the open interest for shorts is decreased then tokens were virtually bought from the pool
