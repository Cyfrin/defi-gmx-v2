Application ideas

```
1. Any integration that can help grow trading volume.

2. A delta-neutral funding fee vault, allowing a user to earn GMX funding fees automatically with a delta-neutral position (e.g. holding ETH and shorting ETH when funding is paying shorts).

3. Or, alternatively, an unhedged version of the above instrument. Where a user just takes a position on the side that pays funding fees, counter-trading the existing traders on GMX.

4. A price impact vault, which capitalises on this opportunity on GMX by automatically capturing the value from positive price impact when it becomes available.
